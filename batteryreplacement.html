<h2>How to Replace a Car Battery</h2>

<h3>1. Locate your battery</h3>
<p>
Reference your car's manual for the location of your 12-volt battery. Most car batteries will be under the hood or below the trunk floor. If located anywhere else, please visit your local mechanic.
</p>

<h3>2. Obtain a Replacement Battery</h3>
<p>
Although most Auto Stores offer free installation when you purchase a battery from the store, the battery will cost significantly more. Purchasing a battery from your local Walmart, Costco, Sam's Club, and Batteries Plus will save you money.
</p>

<h3>3. Identify Terminals</h3>
<p>
A battery will have a positive and negative connection. The positive connection is often identified with a red cover or + symbol near the connection. The negative is usually a bear wire with no covering and a - symbol.
</p>

<h3>4. Remove Connections and Hold Downs</h3>
<p>
A battery contains hazardous materials, and gloves should be worn for the remainder of this repair. Using a socket or wrench set remove your old battery's positive and negative connections. Look for any bracket at the top, bottom, or sides of the battery securing it to your vehicle.
</p>

<h3>5. Remove old battery</h3>
<p>
Your old battery may or may not have a handle to lift it out of your vehicle; if not, be sure you have a good grip when removing it to prevent any damage.
</p>

<h3>6. Cleaning battery terminals</h3>
<p>
Using your terminal cleaner, brush the terminals until you see bare metal for the best connection. Apply your white lithium grease to your connections and terminals to prevent corrosion.
</p>

<h3>7. Installing New Battery</h3>
<p>
Lift the new battery into your vehicle and set it in place of your old battery. Ensure your new battery is in the same orientation as your old battery. Tighten any hold-downs with your socket or wrench set.
</p>

<h3>8. Connect New Battery</h3>
<p>
Connect your new battery, ensuring that you do not connect it backward. If connected backward, severe damage to the vehicle's electronics is possible. Using your socket set or wrench, tighten down your connections.
</p>
