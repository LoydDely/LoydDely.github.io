<h2>How to Change a Flat Tire</h2>

<br>

<h3>Tools / Parts Located in Vehicle</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Spare Tire</li>
	<li>Jack and Crank Tool</li>
	<li>Lug Nut/Bolt Socket and Handle</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>1. Saftey</h3>
<p>
Locate a safe space to pull over and turn on your hazards. Ensure the ground is level and solid, avoid gravel or soft soil, and you are not parked on a hill.
</p>

<h3>2. Locate and Remove your Spare Tire and Jack from your vehicle </h3>
<p>
Only some vehicles are equipped with a spare tire. If equipped, the spare tire, jack, and tools are generally located in the trunk of your car or under the rear bumper. If located under the rear bumper, reference your manual for removal instructions. 
</p>


<h3>3. Placement of Jack</h3>
<p>
Reference your owner's manual for the right location to place your jack under your vehicle. 
</p>


<h3>4. Lossen Lugnuts</h3>
<p>
If your vehicle is equipped with hub caps, pull straight out to remove them. Utilize the tools from your car to break loose the lug nuts/bolts using your legs by pushing the tool with the bottom of your foot.
</p>


<h3>5. Lifting your Vehicle</h3>
<p>
Begin using the tools from your vehicle to elevate the jack and lift the car. Continue to elevate the jack till the tire is off the ground. Do not attempt to catch the jack if it begins to lean and fall. It is safer to let the vehicle fall than to hurt yourself. 
</p>

<h3>6. Removing Lug Nuts and Tire</h3>
<p>
Remove the lug nuts/bolts by hand the rest of the way. The tire will be loose, so remove it from the vehicle by holding it from the sides and being careful not to bump the jack. Place the tire on the ground behind your car.
</p>

<h3>7. Mounting spare tire</h3>
<p>
Pick up your spare tire and mount it to your vehicle using your lug nuts/bolts. Tighten the lug nuts/bolts in a star pattern without shaking your car, causing it to fall off the jack.
</p>

<h3>8. Lowering Vehicle</h3>
<p>
Using the tools from your vehicle, begin lowering it slowly, allowing the tire to support the vehicle's weight. Keep your hands and legs away from the vehicle's underside and tire.
</p>

<h3>9. Tighting Lug Nuts</h3>
<p>
Now that the vehicle is off the jack tighten the lug nuts/bolts more in a star pattern, as they will be loose until you can't do it anymore. Do not use your legs to tighten lug nuts/bolts. 
<p>

<h3>10. Cleaning up </h3>
<p>
Now that you have mounted and tightened your spare tire, place your flat tire, jack, and tools back into your vehicle and Visit your nearest tire store or mechanic for replacement or repair of your tire
</p>
